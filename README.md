A fast glider for slopes and F3F competition.

V-JX is a common project of Jochen Guenzel and Mario Perner where Jochen focuses on aerodynamic design and Mario on engineering and building of the model. 

Within this repository, we want to make a "full stack description" - i.e. from the aerodynamic design to the final build out of molds. As far as possible, we will make the calculations and plans available "open source" and thus also invite to a lively discussion, in which we all will hopefully be a bit smarter in the end.
